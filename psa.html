<!-- #015 [REFETCH] -->
<p>There is a lockdown drill this Wednesday (February 20th) in D period classes from 9:50 to 11:10 am.</p>
<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>apparently the gradient backgrounds were cycling too fast, so they've been slowed down to a 5 second transition that cycles every 10 seconds</li>
  <li>the old quick transitions can still be reenabled in the settings</li>
  <li>cycling can also be turned off altogether</li>
</ul>
