<p>Please tell your Paly friends about <a href="./paly">Upwisha</a>, the schedule web app for Paly students. (not like they'd need it though)</p>
<p>Updates:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gunn schedule parser removes passing periods from brunch and lunch and splits long flexes (&geq; 80 minutes &mdash; this might break in the future)</li>
  <li>it's now a permalink where it says the date and day of the week</li>
  <li>added a week preview</li>
</ul>
