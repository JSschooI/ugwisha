december 6th and 7th have assembly days with multiple flexes; some periods have SELF, some don't, and when there is SELF only one grade has it

this will complicate SELF detection

options:
a. assume all SELF as flex
  - this will remove the app's ability to tell which period is SELF on these confusing assembly days
b. continue assuming days with SELF event have SELF all flex periods
  - this is misleading and will make people think there's double SELF when there isn't
c. only detect SELF if it says SELF in the period name
  - will not work on normal weeks
d. do option b, but if the schedule itself already mentions SELF, do option c
  - (applies to above options as well) cannot distinguish between 9th and 10th grade SELF (a problem on these assembly days)
e. do option b, but if the schedule mentions SELF, detect the grade and show it in the schedule; otherwise, SELF for everyone
  - requires extra UI design and changing how periods are stored

down with self.
