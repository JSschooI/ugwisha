# Ugwisha

Ugwisha is the descendent of [Ugwita](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/) and aims to simply be more visually appealing and have more functionality than Ugwita (though still less than [UGWA](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/)); one of the major complaints about Ugwita is its ugliness (it seems most people judge apps by their appearance).

Feel free to fork this repository and make your own app; just credit me somewhere.

Ugwisha currently supports:

- features all Gunn apps have:
  - working offline
  - time until next period in tab title
  - alternate schedules
  - previewing other days
- UGWA features:
  - custom period names and colours
  - PSA system
  - optional SELF
- Ugwita features
  - automatically change date when there's a new day
  - linking to dates by URL: `?day=yyyy-mm-dd`
- unique features:
  - better design than Ugwita
  - nature, custom, or gradient backgrounds that work offline
  - time until next period in favicon (so Ugwisha can be pinned)
  - split double flex
  - remove passing periods from brunch/lunch

Perhaps Ugwisha may also support:

- a better colour picker
- period descriptions
- zero, H, and staff periods support
- show week previews (like UGWA)
- better date selector
- show events
- randomly selected sheep doodles
- warning the user if it has been too long since they fetched the alternate schedules
- keeping the user from viewing summer break/next year
- weather
- barcode generator

Ugwisha will probably not have:

- club and staff lists
- campus map

## Etymology of "Ugwisha"

`Ugwisha` (**/uˈɡwɪʃa/** or **/uˈɡwiʃa/**) is a portmanteau of `Ugwita` (`Ugwa`&mdash;an alternative letter case form of `UGWA`, which stands for `Unofficial Gunn Web App`&mdash;with the Spanish feminine diminutive `-ita`) and `-ish` because of how Ugwisha is not as functional... *ish*.
