# Ugwisha

Ugwisha is the descendent of [Ugwita](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/) and aims to simply be more visually appealing and have more functionality than Ugwita (though still less than [UGWA](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/)); one of the major complaints about Ugwita is its ugliness (it seems most people judge apps by their appearance).

Feel free to fork this repository and make your own app; just credit me somewhere.

Ugwisha currently supports:

- custom period names
- show time 'til next period in tab title
- custom period colours
- show time left in favicon as well (so Ugwisha can be pinned)
- show alternate schedules and SELF
- preview other days
- look better than Ugwita
- nature images, though this is opt-in; otherwise it'll show random gradients
- work offline
- automatically change date when there's a new day
- let you turn off SELF, and you will be commended for doing so

Perhaps Ugwisha may also support:

- a better colour picker
- period descriptions
- zero, H, and staff periods support
- show week previews (like UGWA)
- better date selector
- split double flex
- remove passing periods from brunch/lunch
- show events
- randomly selected sheep doodles
- warning the user if it has been too long since they fetched the alternate schedules
- keeping the user from viewing summer break/next year
- weather
- cache custom background
- PSA system

Ugwisha will probably not have:
- club and staff lists
- barcode generator
- campus map

## Etymology of "Ugwisha"

`Ugwisha` (**/uˈɡwɪʃa/** or **/uˈɡwiʃa/**) is a portmanteau of `Ugwita` (`Ugwa`&mdash;an alternative letter case form of `UGWA`, which stands for `Unofficial Gunn Web App`&mdash;with the Spanish feminine diminutive `-ita`) and `-ish` because of how Ugwisha is not as functional... *ish*.
