# Ugwisha

Ugwisha is the descendent of [Ugwita](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/lite/) and aims to simply be more visually appealing and have more functionality than Ugwita (though still less than [UGWA](https://orbiit.github.io/gunn-web-app/)); one of the major complaints about Ugwita is its ugliness (it seems most people judge apps by their appearance).

Ugwisha will:

- look better than Ugwita
  - this will include nature images, though this is opt-in; otherwise it'll show random gradients
- work offline
- show alternate schedules and SELF
  - SELF can be turned off, and you will be commended for doing so
- custom period names
- preview other days
- show time 'til next period in tab title

Perhaps Ugwisha may also support:

- custom period colours and a colour picker
- period descriptions
- zero and H period support
- show week previews (like UGWA)
- have things that
- better date selector
- show time left in favicon as well (so Ugwisha can be pinned)

Ugwisha will probably not have:
- club and staff lists
- barcode generator
- campus map
