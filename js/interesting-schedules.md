# 2018-10-10 `PSAT/Grade Level assemblies alternate schedule`

Brunch times aren't listed; `ALL STUDENTS ATTEND` instead of "Flextime"; example of a longer flex period that isn't necessarily double.

```
<span>ALL STUDENTS ATTEND, 8:30-12:00 (brunch served, no lunch)</span><br><span>No afternoon classes</span><br><span>Staff Collaboration (1:00-3:45)</span>
```

These flex periods are actually each double flex (or at least each hold two mini-courses). According to Naviance, the sessions start at 8:25, 9:10, 10:15, and 11:15. Perhaps the flex times are as follows:

- 8:25 &ndash; 9:00 (35 minutes)
- 9:10 &ndash; 10:00 (50 minutes)
- 10:15 &ndash; 11:05 (50 minutes)
- 11:15 &ndash; 12:15 (60 minutes)

There doesn't seem to be a pattern, so Ugwisha will not split these flex periods.

```
Math testing for juniors (8:25-10:00)
Flextime for freshmen, sophomores & seniors (8:25-10:00)
Brunch (10:00-10:15)
Math testing for juniors (10:15-12:15)
Flextime for freshmen, sophomores & seniors (10:15-12:15)
BBQ Lunch for test-takers! (12:15-1:05)
Staff Collaboration (1:15-3:30)
```
